## URL Structure

```
/dashboard                          - Main dashboard
/dashboard/members                  - Members (existing)

/dashboard/loans                    - Loans (existing)
/dashboard/rotations                - Rotation cycles ✨ NEW
/dashboard/rotations/[id]           - Cycle details (TODO)
/dashboard/meetings                 - Meetings list ✨ NEW
/dashboard/meetings/new             - Schedule meeting (TODO)
/dashboard/meetings/[id]            - Meeting details & attendance (TODO)

```

## Styling & Design

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Green (existing chama theme)
- Blue: Informational, meetings
- Teal: Rotations
- Red: Alerts, fines
- Pink: Welfare
- Yellow: Warnings, pending states
- Gray: Neutral, completed states

**Layout:**
- Consistent padding: p-6 for cards
- Standard border radius: rounded-lg
- Shadow: shadow-sm with shadow-md on hover
- Grid layouts: Responsive with breakpoints (md, lg)

## Data Flow

All pages use the same pattern:
```typescript
1. useState for data and loading
2. useEffect to fetch on mount
3. Async fetch functions
4. Loading state display
5. Empty state with call-to-action
6. Data rendering with mapping
```

## Client-Side Features

**Interactive Elements:**
- Filter tabs with active state
- Clickable stat cards
- Action buttons (approve, pay, waive)
- Modals (rotation create ready)
- Form submissions (TODO)

**State Management:**
- Local component state with useState
- No global state management (can add Context/Zustand later)
- Optimistic updates on actions
- Alert confirmations for destructive actions

## Next Steps for Full Completion

1. `/dashboard/rotations/[id]` - Distribution management
2. `/dashboard/meetings/[id]` - Attendance tracking
3. `/dashboard/welfare/requests/[id]` - Request details

### Priority 2: Form Pages
1. `/dashboard/meetings/new` - Schedule meeting form
2. `/dashboard/welfare/request` - Submit request form
3. `/dashboard/welfare/contribute` - Record contribution form
