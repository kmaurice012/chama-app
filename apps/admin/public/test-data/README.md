## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Import
Use the files as-is to test successful bulk import flow

### Scenario 2: Duplicate Detection
Try uploading `members-sample.csv` twice - should fail with duplicate email errors

### Scenario 3: Missing Member Error
1. Skip Step 1 (don't import members)
2. Try importing contributions directly
3. Should fail because member emails don't exist

### Scenario 4: Duplicate Contribution
1. Import contributions successfully
2. Try uploading `contributions-sample.csv` again
3. Should fail with duplicate contribution errors (same member + month + year)

### Scenario 5: Invalid Data
Modify a CSV file to test validation:
- Remove required fields
- Use invalid email formats
- Use non-numeric amounts
- Use invalid dates
